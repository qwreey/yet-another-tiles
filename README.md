# Yet Another Tiles 

Yet Another Tiles is a hard fork of Awesome Tiles which was created by velitasali and contributors.

Awesome Tiles is a tiling manager extension for GNOME Shell that makes it easy to move 
windows around with precision. It does that with reconfigurable keyboard shortcuts 
which are set to keys on the number pad by default.
